  PLEASE NOTE:
  Currently the https://github.com/dnvriend/akka-persistence-inmemory is NOT working for Aggregate Root tests
  because it is not possible to use a separate instance writing the events that should be in the event store
  before you actually create the aggregate root (should replay those stored events) to check execution of a new
  command.
  A new configuration that uses the akka bundled inmem storage is added to create a working situation.
